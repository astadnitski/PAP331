Here is the idea.

---

Part 1

Using Pythia, simulate muons at 13 TeV

Output transverse momentum and psuedorapidity in the same C++ script

With PyROOT script, read the above data and plot using ROOT

---

Part 2

Probability stuff should be easy, just calculate the fraction of accepted events over total events
