Description of the detector:

Rectangular, series of absorber layers with gaps in between (two different materials alternating)

Originally the absorber material is lead. Change it to water by editing DetectorConstruction class: auto absorberMaterial = G4Material::GetMaterial("G4_WATER");



--- Process

Steps used to produce images:

1. Define $G4 variables in installation

2. Add to path: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${G4INSTALL}/lib

3. Add DAWN to path: export PATH=${PATH}:/home/stadnits/programs/dawn_3_91a

4. Switch to build folder

5. cmake -DGeant4_DIR=${G4INSTALL}/lib/Geant4-11.1.1 $G4INSTALL/share/Geant4/examples/basic/B4/B4a

6. make

7. Comment/uncomment in B4a vis.mac to visualize with DAWN instead of OGL

8. ./exampleB4a

- To change the detector material to water, edit DetectorConstruction.cc in SRC folder and repeat steps 5-8

- Next depends on the particle.



--- Electron:

- /gun/particle e-

- /gun/energy 10 GeV

- /run/beamOn 1

- OK

- save lead EPS as electronLead.eps, water EPS as electronWater.eps


--- Alpha particle:

- /gun/particle alpha

- /gun/energy 10 GeV

- /run/beamOn 1

- OK

- save lead EPS as protonLead.eps, water EPS as protonWater.eps


--- Proton:

- /gun/particle proton

- /gun/energy 10 GeV

- /run/beamOn 1

- OK

- save lead EPS as alphaLead.eps, water EPS as alphaWater.eps
