The idea:
- Install Pythia, LHAPDF, and selected PDF as in example
- C++ script using Pythia to generate the data
- Compile C++ with makefile
- Run job to save C++ output to txt file
- Python sript uses Pyroot to plot data from txt file
- Clean

Steps:
- make all: makes list, masses
- make list (needed for part 1)
-- savelist.job
- make masses (needed for part 2)
-- savemasses.job
- python2 CalculateWidth.py (outputs results for parts 1 & 2, makes plot)
-- more widthRESULTS (see results)
